> This challenge is meant for full-time Android developers. Interns can apply by completing the [Responsive challenge](../android/README.md).

1. [mDNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_DNS), also known as Bonjour/Zeroconf/Avahi, is a protocol for discovery of devices and services on a local network - e.g. printers.
2. [Bonjour Browser](https://github.com/wellenvogel/BonjourBrowser) is an open source Android app for discovering and browsing mDNS devices and services.
3. Your assignment is to build a clone of this app with:
   1. Discovery of devices
   2. Listing of devices
   3. Filtering of devices via a toolbar menu
4. Build the code and share screenshots and an APK. Also explain the approach you took and any specific issues you faced and debugged.
5. Submit your repo and a brief note to [work@iotready.co](mailto:work@iotready.co)
